# nick.golf

This is a website to post projects I work on. Here, I'll go over how I made it, some reasons why it exists, and whatever else i think of.


## How it's Made

This website was created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. A hugo project consists of your own content, project files, and a theme. A theme is a pre-built design for the structure and style of your pages. There are many themes available on hugos website or on github, or you can write your own. For this project I wrote my own theme, taking inspiration from Luke Smith's [lugo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo) theme. The content of the website is created using simple markdown files. On site build, hugo will apply the theme to your markdown files, creating HTML for you. For custom pages, you can create additional layouts beyond the theme using your personal project files.

I chose Hugo mainly because I like the minimalist approach to website creation it provides and it looked like fun to learn and use. I'm a backend developer, so I'm generally not interested in frontend Javascript frameworks like React, and it would also be overkill for a simple text-based site like this. 


## Why does it exist?

I could just post my projects on [github](https://github.com/nickzombolas), and I do, but I also wanted to create my own space. I think it's worth it for a couple reasons.

First, why not? It's cheap and easy to create your own website, and I appreciate the independence it gives me. Now, I'm an internet landlord instead of a tenant at some other site. Second, it's also worth just knowing how to do because it'll probably come in handy. I don't really use HTML and CSS often so this keeps me from forgetting, and it's useful to know methods of hosting and deploying applications. I'll probably use this site as an experiment to try whatever ideas i have, and maybe I'll write about it. Or maybe I'll get bored and not post for a very long time, who knows.
